### Brief project description

For this project, we will explore what optimal combination of weather and pricing data will result in the most accurate electricity demand forecasts. In order to address this question, we will develop an ensemble model utilising a combination of 3 of the most accurately reported unitary demand models from the literature to forecast electricity demand. This will be achieved using different combinations of weather and pricing data such that the effect of relying on each becomes evident. Any synergistic effects will also be noted.
